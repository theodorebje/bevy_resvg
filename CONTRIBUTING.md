# Contributing to Bevy Resvg

Thank you so much for contributing! All contributions are welcome here. This
project isn't very mature yet, so I am sure there are countless bugs and missing
features. If you have a bug or feature request, please open an issue on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/theodorebje/bevy_resvg/issues)! There is no
issue template, so just include whatever you believe is appropiate.

## Submitting code

Just open a [PR](https://github.com/theodorebje/bevy_resvg/pulls)! Again, there
are no guidelines for how to write your MR, as long as it adds value to the
project, I'll happily merge it. Please make sure there are no Clippy warnings
and that you have run `cargo fmt` before submitting, though. All help is
appreciated.

If you have [git-sumi](https://sumi.rs/) installed, feel free to use the
provided [sumi.toml](/sumi.toml) file. Otherwise, don't bother. I'll reword your
message to fit the
[Conventional Commits spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) for you 😁
